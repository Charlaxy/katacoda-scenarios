###### *oc cluster up*

`oc cluster up` is a command provided by OC Tools. It configures and runs an OpenShift environment running inside of the native Docker system for your operating system. It supports Windows, OS X, and Linux. To get started with OC Tools, visit:
https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/docs/cluster_up_down.md

If you decide to try out *oc cluster up*, and you should, I would also suggest that you take a look at a wrapper script that was created to make life a little bit easier for you called *oc cluster wrapper*. This wrapper provides functionality such as the ability to have different profiles, persistent volume management, and other great features. You can find more information at the official Git repository at: https://github.com/openshift-evangelists/oc-cluster-wrapper
